# node-tcp-proxy - v0.1.0

### Features

* Reverse proxies incoming tcp streams
* Monitors backend hosts for availability, balances between them
* Minimal request overhead and latency
* Written entirely in Javascript
* Easy to use API

### When to use node-tcp-proxy

Let's suppose you were running multiple http application servers, and all of these app servers need to connect to some sort of database. Well unfortunately(fortunately?) you're lazy like me and don't want to throw up another haproxy instance. So instead you setup node-tcp-proxy on each of the app servers to proxy database requests to multiple HA configured backends. The app server connects to its locally hosted node-tcp-proxy which watches the backend servers for availability and brokers the connection to a randomly chosen, available backend.

### Installing npm (node package manager)

```curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh```

### Installing node-tcp-proxy

If you don't plan on using the provided cli client, this is all you need:
```npm install tcp-proxy```

If you intend on using the provided cli client, then have to do the following:
```npm install -g tcp-proxy``

Then in the root of your application run:
```npm link```

## Using node-tcp-proxy

There are several ways to use node-tcp-proxy; the library is designed to be flexible so that it can be used by itself, or in conjunction with other node.js libraries / tools.

See the [examples][1] for working sample code.

Invoke it like so:

```node-tcp-proxy --help```



## Using node-tcp-proxy from the command line

When you install this package with npm, a node-tcp-proxy binary will become available to you. Using this binary is easy with some simple options:

Invoke it like so:

```node-tcp-proxy --help```

Remember, if you want to use this command globally, install the package globally

## Why doesn't node-tcp-proxy have more advanced features like x, y, or z?

If you have a suggestion for a feature currently not supported, feel free to open a [support issue][2]. node-tcp-proxy is designed to just proxy tcp requests from one server to another.
